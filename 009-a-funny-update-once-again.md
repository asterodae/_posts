**hello.**

sorry everyone for not really blogging anymore, life has just been well... pretty boring to say the least lol
the holidays were boring, i met with my mom and my brother nad that was about it, got new shoes but oh well.. i dont really care about shoes that much though they are cool and i still rly appreciated it :3

either way, as a short update, this blog is now... i guess open-source? idk
what im trying to say is, ive now uploaded all of my funky little posts on <a href="https://github.com/asterodae/_posts">github</a>! mostly just to make it easier to sync it between my webserver and my local machines, but also just because i had the ability to lmao

for people who actually care, this entire blog is run on hexo, which is from what i remember open-source (just checked, yes it is! check it out on <a href="https://hexo.io">hexo.io</a> :3) with a theme that is also open-source and i think was called the cactus theme or something similar

anyways, i do have another blog planned for all of you in a bit, since i finally am fully switching to android from iOS and i have some things to share about that

hope u're all doing good :3
